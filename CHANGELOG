    Initial release: Static data flow-based analysis of JavaScript files to detect syntactic clones

	* Program Dependency Graph Analysis: static analysis of JavaScript files to build the AST, which we enhance with control and data flow information to build a PDG;
	* Slicing-Based Clone Detection: using backward slicing with respect to the control and data flow, we traverse a benign and a malicious AST to detect syntactic clones.
